The Vulnerability
-----------------

**Bug class:** object state confusion leading to use-after-free

**Vulnerability details:**

`ep_loop_check_proc()` is trying to increment the refcount of a file with `get_file()`. However, `get_file()` is only allowed when a refcounted reference is already held to the file; and `ep_loop_check_proc()` instead relies on locking `ep->mtx` to protect the weak reference to the file from concurrent removal by `eventpoll_release()`, which doesn't prevent encountering a file with refcount zero.

Here is a diagram of the relevant lifetime states of `struct file`:

![](https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-1048-file-states.png)

Essentially, `get_file()` is called on an object that may be in a state in which `get_file()` is not permitted.

**Patch analysis:**

`get_file()` is replaced with `get_file_rcu()`, which is valid for (a superset of) all possible states of the file.

**Thoughts on how this vuln might have been found _(fuzzing, code auditing, variant analysis, etc.)_:** Since the bug was quickly fixed in upstream Linux, but not in all Android devices, there's a good chance that the attackers specifically searched for memory corruption fixes that are present upstream but not in Android devices.

This reminds me of [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html) , another case where a bug was fixed upstream but not in all Android kernels.

**(Historical/present/future) context of bug:**

The commit that introduced the bug (and fixed another one) was included in the Android Security Bulletin for December 2020, forcing all Android vendors to include that commit. However, the fix for this bug, despite quickly landing in upstream stable kernels (see "Affected Versions" above), was only included in an Android Security Bulletin in November 2021.

This means that devices by Android vendors who only cherrypick bugfixes referenced in Android Security Bulletins, rather than pulling the complete Android common kernel tree, will have been vulnerable for almost a year, even though upstream stable releases (and Android common kernels) were only affected for ~2-3 weeks.

That doesn't necessarily mean that all Android devices were affected that long though; for example, Pixel 4 XL devices seem to have been patched in their March 2021 security update through the periodic LTS update from 4.14.191 to 4.14.199. The kernel versions that were shipped to Pixel 4 XL devices are (from running `strings` on `boot.img` in the firmware images):

*   in the December 2020 update: `4.14.191-gf6c9439f069c-ab6924784` (still vulnerable?)
*   in the January 2021 update: `4.14.191-gd36f32db91a3-ab6960308` (still vulnerable?)
*   in the February 2021 update: `4.14.191-gd36f32db91a3-ab7006457` (still vulnerable?)
*   in the March 2021 update: `4.14.199-g815ef3fd6754-ab7079165` (fixed)
*   in the April 2021 update: `4.14.199-gb0863551cb91-ab7132611` (fixed)

The Exploit
-----------

(The terms _exploit primitive_, _exploit strategy_, _exploit technique_, and _exploit flow_ are [defined here](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-survey-of-recent-ios-kernel-exploits.html).)

**Exploit strategy (or strategies):** N/A - no exploit sample to analyze

**Exploit flow:**

**Known cases of the same exploit flow:**

**Part of an exploit chain?**

The Next Steps
--------------

### Variant analysis

**Areas/approach for variant analysis (and why):**

I think there are two approaches for variant analysis here:

1.  Check whether any Linux kernel patches listed in Android Security Bulletins are referenced by other commits in the `Fixes:` tag, and verify for any hits that they either aren't security-relevant or have also been included in an ASB.
2.  Look whether there are any other codepaths that extract a file from an epoll item and assume that its refcount is non-zero.

**Found variants:**

I found no variants with clear security implications.

Re #1, the following upstream Linux commits referenced in bulletins from 2020 and 2021 are referenced by followup fix commits:

    *   followup: 8d67743653dc (`futex: Unbreak futex hashing`)
        *   performance regression fix, theoretically also correctness fix

Re #2: The only place that looks vaguely interesting in that regard is `ep_item_poll()`: From what I can tell, it can invoke `vfs_poll()` on a file whose refcount is already zero, but only before the file's `->release()` handler is called. But I think that's fine.

### Structural improvements

What are structural improvements such as ways to kill the bug class, prevent the introduction of this vulnerability, mitigate the exploit flow, make this type of vulnerability harder to exploit, etc.?

**Ideas to kill the bug class:** In my opinion, the bug class here is "object state confusion", and killing the bug class would have to involve using static analysis and annotations to sanity-check whether object states match the requirements.

**Ideas to mitigate the exploit flow:** N/A

**Other potential improvements:** When cherrypicking specific security fixes, it would probably be a good idea to at least monitor the upstream repository for commits that refer to the cherrypicked patch with `Fixes:`.

### 0-day detection methods

What are potential detection methods for similar 0-days? Meaning are there any ideas of how this exploit or similar exploits could be detected **as a 0-day**?
